# PyCitySchools

In this jupyter notebook,  standardized test results from schools across a school district were analyzed.

Tables were created to view an overall summary of the district and a summary by each school. The school summary table allowed us to view the top and bottom performing schools.

Further, we also looked at test scores by grade at each school.

Finally, we also created tables that allowed us to analyze performance of schools by budget (per student), size, and school type.

A detailed report of the findings is included at the bottom of the jupyter notebook which includes all tables.


PyCitySchools File Structure:
 * The "Resources" directory with the CSV files used to perform the data analysis.
 * The PyCitySchools.ipynb notebook includes the full code used to perform the analysis, all summary tables, and a report.
 * The ResultsOnly.ipynb notebook includes a trimmed version of the notebook above with just the generated summary tables and report.
